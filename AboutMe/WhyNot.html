                    <li>
                        Lack of curiosity
                        <hr>
                        </hr>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Find Your Curiosity: Ask yourself if programming truly interests you. If your honest answer is
             that it doesn’t, go find something that you are interested in. Save yourself the time and energy. But if
             your answer is “Yes”, then push yourself find something new that you haven’t noticed before, recognize the
             vast ocean and dive a little deeper.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Lack of autonomy and resourcefulness
                        <hr>
                        </hr>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Use the Resources: Recognize that all the answers you need really are out there. When you have a question,
             force yourself to google it before asking someone else for the answer and check the documentation. Save
             the time of others for when you have tried and truly failed to find the answer you need.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Lack of persistence in the face of a problem
                        <hr>
                        </hr>

                    <p>
                        Patient Acceptance: You need to recognize that
             problems come with the territory and are not problems, but in fact challenges. Every challenge you face
             and overcome gives you deeper understanding and a better ability to face new challenges, and quickly
             resolve old ones.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        No feeling of success in overcoming a problem

                    <p>
                        Celebrate
             Your Wins: Whenever you solve a problem that you struggled with, no matter how small, always take pride in
             your accomplishment, take a break and congratulate yourself for a job well done. Let the feeling of
             success sink in and energize you for the next problem you face.

                        Acknowledge Your Progress: There is a lot to learn, and the journey of
             programming never ends. But the knowledge is cumulative, so take pride it what you do know, and trust that
             every effort you take in your learning will create a strong foundation of knowledge for wherever your
             career takes you.

                        Your Mind is a Muscle:
             Trust that your brain is like a muscle — as you use it, it gets better and more efficient in it’s
             thinking. As you put pieces together and develop mental concepts, it becomes much easier to discover
             solutions.

                    <p>
                        Think for yourself: Through your
             experience and critical thinking skills, develop your own perspectives. Make reasonable guesses, take a
             position, and be willing to change as new information comes to light.

                        Self Reflection: You need to take a step back, and look at the
             bigger picture of how you are approaching things. How can you do this better? Is there anything you can do
             to make your life easier? What are you missing that could help you?
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Needing
             the “right” answer instead of recognizing a spectrum of “good” and “bad” answers
                        <hr>
                        </hr>

                    <p>
                        Get Creative:
             Recognize that there are numerous ways to solve a problem, and through experience and exposure, you will
             develop a nuanced understanding overtime about which solutions feel better than others. Looking at the big
             picture, imagining different possibilities and trusting your gut will lead to better solutions that are
             more satisfying.

                    <p>
                        Pay Attention to
             the Details: The details matter and you have to accept that. Once you do, you can begin to always be
             scanning your code for anything that is out of place. You can organize your code and use tools that help
             you identify issues quickly.
